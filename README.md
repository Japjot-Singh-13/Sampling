# RESULTS
For LR (Logistic Regression), the highest accuracy is achieved with Cluster Sampling.
For KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), the highest accuracy is achieved with Cluster Sampling.
For GradientBoosting, the highest accuracy is achieved with Cluster Sampling.
For GNB (Gaussian Naive Bayes), the highest accuracy is achieved with Stratified Sampling.
For SVC (Support Vector Classifier), the highest accuracy is achieved with Cluster Sampling.
# Final Result
Therefore, in general, Cluster Sampling seems to be the most effective sampling technique
